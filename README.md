## Describe your hackathon project and how it addresses the theme that you have selected
Praisinator is a chat bot and web app that helps collect user feedback and monitor the tone of team conversations over slack using IBM's Tone API. The passive data collection via the bots ability to listen to the conversation and send it to the Tone API for analysis in combination with actual user feedback gives teams the data on how they may be able to communicate better. 

Once the data is collected, users can visit the web app to see the data visualized. We use a number of graphs to display the overall emotion, writing, and social analysis of messages, channels, users, and even the team as a whole.
